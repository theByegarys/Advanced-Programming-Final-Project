Description:
The Human Pose Estimation code utilizing OpenPose in Python with OpenCV enables accurate identification and tracking of key human body joints, providing valuable insights into body posture and movement. OpenPose, a popular pose estimation library, is integrated to achieve real-time performance on various devices.

Key Features:
OpenPose Integration: The code leverages the OpenPose library, which excels in multi-person pose estimation, to detect and locate key joints such as shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles.

Real-time Processing:
The optimized implementation ensures fast and accurate pose estimation in real-time, making it suitable for applications like fitness tracking, gesture recognition, and human-computer interaction.

Input Flexibility:
The code supports both image and video inputs, allowing users to analyze static images or dynamically track human poses in video streams.

Output Visualization:
The detected human poses are visually represented through lines connecting the key joints, providing a clear understanding of the body's configuration.

Customization:
The code allows users to fine-tune parameters for their specific use cases, enabling flexibility in pose estimation accuracy and speed trade-offs.
